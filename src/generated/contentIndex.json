We don't guarantee outcomes. For changing details, use [Official links](/official-links).\n\n### Step 4: Housing (staged, not rushed)\n\nIf possible: short stay → view in person → verify → sign. Rushing deposits is where families get burned.\n\n### Step 5: Learning & community\n\nA good-fit learning environment plus one parent community usually does more for \"settling in\" than any single logistics hack.\n\n## What we learned the hard way\n\nThe biggest stress reducer wasn't \"perfect planning\"—it was **staged commitments**. Keep optionality early, then commit once you've seen the reality.\n\n## Next steps\n\n- [Visas](/visas)\n- [Housing](/housing)\n- [Areas](/areas)\n- [Guides](/guides)\n"

The real question is how support works **day-to-day**.\n\nUseful questions:\n- What does support look like in a normal week?\n- Who provides it (class teacher, support teacher, counselor)?\n- How is progress shared with parents?\n\n### 3) Safety + supervision (clarity over vibes)\n\nYou don’t need perfection — you need **clear systems**:\n- supervision ratios,\n- pick-up / drop-off routine,\n- injury protocol,\n- who contacts you and how.\n\n### 4) Commute reality\n\nIn Bali, commute is *not* a small detail. It affects:\n- your child’s daily energy,\n- your ability to have routines,\n- whether the move feels calm or chaotic.\n\nDo a real-time commute test (or ask parents in your target area what their actual times are).\n\n### 5) Parent communication + community\n\nStrong schools communicate early and clearly:\n- expectations,\n- what happens when a child struggles,\n- how parents stay in the loop,\n- what community support exists for new families.\n\n---\n\n## A simple shortlist process (that avoids overwhelm)\n\n1) **Write your non-negotiables** (support needs, learning style, commute max, language needs).\n2) Shortlist **2–3 areas** first. (Start here: [Areas hub](/areas).)\n3) Pick **3–5 schools** across those areas.\n4) Tour **2–4** of the best fits.\n5) Use a trial period if available.\n\nIf you want a copy/paste tour checklist, use:\n- [What to ask on a school tour](/guides/what-to-ask-on-a-school-tour)\n- [School tour question list](/resources/school-tour-question-list)\n\n---\n\n## Empathy School (Ubud): tours + programs\n\n<div class=\"rounded-2xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 p-6\">\n  <strong class=\"text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900\">Why we include Empathy School here</strong>\n  <p class=\"mt-3 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600\">This hub is built by Empathy School, and we’re one of the few groups with real, public video tours.

Can you accommodate medication plans?\n- **Refunds:** What are the terms if a child gets sick or plans change?\n- **Communication:** How will you update parents—daily notes, WhatsApp, email?\n\n---\n\n## Video: Nature camp (what a day can feel like)\n\n<div class=\"mt-4 overflow-hidden rounded-2xl border border-gray-200\">\n  <div class=\"aspect-video w-full\">\n    <iframe\n      src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxwJfJxF51Y\"\n      title=\"Empathy School Nature Camp\"\n      loading=\"lazy\"\n      class=\"h-full w-full\"\n      allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n      referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"\n      allowfullscreen\n    ></iframe>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<details class=\"mt-4 rounded-2xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 p-5\">\n  <summary class=\"text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900\">How to watch this like a parent (not a tourist)</summary>\n  <div class=\"mt-4 whitespace-pre-wrap text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600\">\nWhile you watch, try to answer:\n- Do you see consistent adult presence (supervision you can feel)?\n- Does the day look over-scheduled, chaotic, or calm?\n- Would your child thrive with this amount of outdoor time and group energy?\n\nThen follow up with the checklist questions—because the “boring details” are what make camps feel safe.\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Seasonal camps (winter / summer / mid-term holidays)\n\nSeasonal camps are great for:\n- families visiting from overseas during school breaks,\n- families living in Bali who want structured blocks during holidays.\n\nBecause dates change, we treat seasonal content as **examples + social proof**, not the source-of-truth schedule.\n\n<div class=\"mt-4 rounded-2xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 p-6\">\n  <strong class=\"text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900\">Seasonal snapshots (supporting posts)</strong>\n  <p class=\"mt-3 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600\">If you want current dates, use the contact form and we’ll share what’s available.</p>\n  <ul class=\"mt-4 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600\">\n    <li>Winter camp snapshot: https://www.instagram.com/empathy.school/p/DQ6G6XjkVoi/</li>\n    <li>Winter camp vibe: https://www.instagram.com/empathy.school/p/DTKdXFTgeg9/</li>\n    <li>Winter camp countdown (reel): https://www.instagram.com/empathy.school/reel/DRQ8ZF7kesd/</li>\n    <li>Other seasonal options (reel): https://www.instagram.com/empathy.school/reel/DS1F4lGD3UM/</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## Weekly programs (great for 3–12 month stays)\n\nIf your family is staying for a season (or you’re easing into life here), weekly programs can be a strong middle ground:\n- more stable routine than a one-off holiday camp,\n- lower “commitment risk” than full enrollment,\n- easier to adjust if your area/housing changes.\n\nUseful references:\n- Weekly Nature Scholar Program: https://www.instagram.com/empathy.school/p/DPc6tnVER8Z/\n- Flexible 1–2 day options: https://www.instagram.com/empathy.school/p/DR4GYsZEW5D/\n\n---\n\n## What we learned the hard way\n\nThe biggest stress reducer wasn’t “finding the perfect camp.” It was choosing camps with **clear systems**:\n- clear supervision,\n- clear policies,\n- clear refund terms,\n- clear communication.\n\nA great vibe without clarity often becomes stressful by day two.\n\n---\n\n## What to watch out for (practical red flags)\n\n- No written supervision/safety policy (or they dodge simple questions).\n- Vague drop-off / pick-up process (especially for younger kids).\n- Pressure to pay a deposit before you’ve seen a schedule or terms.\n- No allergy/medical plan.\n- Communication is chaotic (slow, inconsistent, or unclear).\n\nIf you’re unsure, start with a shorter commitment and reassess.\n\n---\n\n## Next steps\n\n- Want a calm plan first?

We don’t guarantee outcomes. For changing details, use [Official links](/official-links).\n\n### Step 4: Housing (staged, not rushed)\n\nIf possible: short stay → view in person → verify → sign. Rushing deposits is where families get burned.\n\n### Step 5: Learning & community\n\nA good-fit learning environment plus one parent community usually does more for “settling in” than any single logistics hack.\n\nIf you want the “community” piece to be easier, build it deliberately:\n- choose one routine where you see the same parents repeatedly,\n- show up consistently,\n- and let relationships form over time.\n\n---\n\n## Community: how families actually meet people\n\nMost families don’t “find community” by hunting for the perfect WhatsApp group.\n\nIn practice, community usually happens through:\n- **school pick-up** (or camp pick-up),\n- one weekly class/sport,\n- a consistent market/cafe routine,\n- volunteering (when it fits).\n\nIf you want a deeper guide: [Finding community in Bali with kids](/guides/finding-community-in-bali-with-kids).\n\n### A small visual glimpse (supporting reel)\n\n<div class=\"mt-4 overflow-hidden rounded-2xl border border-gray-200 bg-white\">\n  <iframe\n    src=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQjCq30kR-O/embed\"\n    title=\"Parents after school (Empathy School)\"\n    loading=\"lazy\"\n    class=\"w-full\"\n    style=\"min-height:520px\"\n  ></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<details class=\"mt-4 rounded-2xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 p-5\">\n  <summary class=\"text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900\">Key takeaways (how to apply this)</summary>\n  <div class=\"mt-4 whitespace-pre-wrap text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600\">\n- Don’t optimize too early.

Culture differs by village and context.\n\nIf you want a copy/paste version: [Culture with kids: quick checklist](/resources/culture-with-kids-quick-checklist).\n\n---\n\n## Quick start\n\n- Start with **one** cultural touchpoint that’s easy for kids (song, language, small ritual).\n- When invited to ceremonies, **ask first**: “Is it okay if we join/watch? Where should we stand?”\n- Keep it short for children (snacks + water + exit plan).\n\n---\n\n## What “respectful participation” looks like in practice\n\n### 1) Ask first (and accept “no” gracefully)\n\nSimple scripts that work:\n- “Is it okay for us to join?”\n- “Where should we stand?”\n- “Is it okay to take a photo?”\n\nWhen you ask, you’re signaling you understand you’re a guest.\n\n### 2) Dress and behavior\n\nFamilies do best when they default to:\n- modest clothing,\n- calm, quiet voices,\n- following the flow instead of improvising.\n\nIf you’re unsure about what’s expected, copy the checklist: [Culture with kids: quick checklist](/resources/culture-with-kids-quick-checklist).\n\n### 3) Phones and filming\n\nWe’ve found the “lowest-risk” rule is:\n- **ask first**,\n- film less than you think,\n- avoid close-ups of people,\n- and put the phone away quickly.\n\n### 4) Make it kid-friendly\n\nEven culturally beautiful moments can be overwhelming for kids.\n\nWhat helps:\n- short duration,\n- clear boundaries (“we’re watching quietly for 10 minutes”),\n- a quiet exit plan,\n- a gentle debrief after.\n\n---\n\n## Supporting social context (optional)\n\nIf you’d like a small example of culture/wellness moments families sometimes join, this reel is supporting context:\n\n- Melukat reel: https://www.instagram.com/empathy.school/reel/DQdzsASEftg/\n\n(Reminder: social is supporting context. The written guide is the primary answer.)\n\n---\n\n## What we learned the hard way\n\nThe mistake isn’t “not knowing enough.”\n\nThe mistake is **acting too confident**.\n\nHumility works here. Asking works. Following works.\n\n---\n\n## A gentle next step\n\nIf your family is planning a move and wants the broader context:\n\n- [Family life pillar](/family-life)\n- [Start here (roadmap)](/start-here)\n- [Schools & learning](/schools)\n"

For many families it means:\n- being able to go to a class or café with supervision nearby\n- being able to move around with a driver or trusted transport plan\n- walking short distances safely (depends heavily on the street)\n\n### 3) Activity density\nTeens need options.

Your exact street matters a lot.\n\n### Sanur\n- Often feels calmer and more routine-friendly\n- Easier “family loop” day-to-day\n- Tradeoff: nightlife is quieter; some families find it “too calm” after a few months  \nExplore: [/areas/sanur](/areas/sanur)\n\n### Ubud\n- Nature, slower pace, lots of kid-friendly classes and community\n- Tradeoff: humidity, rain patterns, and some roads can be slower than you expect  \nExplore: [/areas/ubud](/areas/ubud)\n\n### Renon / Denpasar (family base option)\n- More “city practical” for appointments and services\n- Tradeoff: not a beach/nature vibe; you’ll drive for weekend scenery  \nExplore: [/areas/renon](/areas/renon) and [/areas/denpasar](/areas/denpasar)\n\n### Jimbaran / Nusa Dua (resort-adjacent routine)\n- Often predictable, quieter, and easier for beach days\n- Tradeoff: it can feel “spread out” and car-dependent  \nExplore: [/areas/jimbaran](/areas/jimbaran) and [/areas/nusa-dua](/areas/nusa-dua)\n\n## Areas to approach carefully (not “bad,” just plan for reality)\n\n### Canggu / Berawa / Pererenan\nThese can work beautifully — but traffic and noise can be real.\n\nIf you’re considering them, do a test stay and ask:\n- “Can we do groceries and one activity without losing the whole day?”\n- “Are we okay with scooters around our daily route?”\nExplore: [/areas/canggu](/areas/canggu), [/areas/berawa](/areas/berawa), [/areas/pererenan](/areas/pererenan)\n\n### Seminyak / Kerobokan\nGreat access to restaurants and services, but can feel busy.\nExplore: [/areas/seminyak](/areas/seminyak), [/areas/kerobokan](/areas/kerobokan)\n\n## Checklist: toddler test-stay questions\n\nCopy/paste this into your notes:\n\n- Where is the closest clinic we’d actually use?\n- How long is groceries → home at 5pm?\n- Where do we go for a 30-minute “reset” outside?\n- Is our home cool enough for naps?\n- Can we find familiar foods quickly?\n- What’s our rainy-day activity plan?\n\n## Next steps\n\n- If you haven’t yet: start with the family roadmap: [/start-here](/start-here)\n- Compare a few areas quickly: [/areas](/areas)\n- Then plan a test stay: [/guides/two-week-test-stay-plan](/guides/two-week-test-stay-plan)\n"

      "body": "\nBy Eric\n\nSome mornings in Bali start with a soundtrack you didn’t know you needed.\n\nA rooster somewhere in the distance. The soft clink of temple bells. A scooter humming past slowly—less “rush hour,” more “someone’s going to buy fruit.” Incense drifting in from a tiny offering placed neatly on the edge of a driveway. My kids outside, barefoot, already inventing a game out of sticks and leaves and whatever the jungle decides to contribute that day.\n\nIt’s the kind of scene people fly across the world to witness for a week.\n\nAnd yet the thing that still surprises me most isn’t the beauty. It’s the convenience.\n\nBecause in the background of all that calm—rice fields flowing like green water, the jungle breathing, the space to actually hear yourself think—Bali has quietly built something that makes daily family life feel… manageable. Even comfortable. Sometimes weirdly effortless.\n\nThe number that captures it best is 45,000 rupiah.\n\nThat’s the delivery fee I pay for groceries when I don’t want to turn the day into a traffic mission. Less than $3 for someone to bring what my family needs right to our door.\n\nIt sounds like a small detail. It’s not.\n\nThe best Bali days don’t begin in a car\n\nWhen families imagine moving to Bali, they picture the big things first:\n\nNature\n\nCommunity\n\nA slower pace\n\nA healthier rhythm for their kids\n\nAll true.\n\nBut the part you only learn by living here is that your day-to-day happiness often depends on the small things: How easy is it to get what you need? How often do errands hijack your schedule? How much time do you spend stuck in transit instead of actually living?\n\nThat’s where Bali has been a joyful surprise for me.\n\nIf I need something—anything from household essentials to random “we ran out of that and my kids will absolutely notice” items—I open Tokopedia or Shopee, search, tap, and it’s handled. What still amazes me is how often it’s more affordable than America, and how reliably it just works.\n\nIt’s not flashy. It’s just… supportive.\n\nAnd for a family, support is everything.\n\n“Western groceries” without the weekly expedition\n\nI still like going to big grocery stores sometimes. There’s something satisfying about it—choosing, browsing, finding a new snack you didn’t know existed.\n\nBut I don’t want that to be my default rhythm. I don’t want “getting groceries” to be a project that consumes half a day and all my patience.\n\nSo for many of our staples—especially the “Western products” my family likes—I use online grocery services like Delta online.\n\nAnd then that number shows up again:\n\nRp 45,000.\n\nNot just a fee—more like a quiet life upgrade.\n\nBecause what that buys isn’t only delivery. It buys time. It buys energy. It buys the kind of afternoon where you’re not recovering from errands—you’re actually present for your kids.\n\nFresh vegetables that don’t require a plan\n\nThen there’s the produce side of life, where Bali shines in its own way.\n\nFor vegetables, I use Bali Jiva.\n\nThere’s something deeply satisfying about waking up in a place with temples and rice fields and sunlight pouring in—then having crisp greens show up without you needing to navigate the day around it.\n\nIt’s one of those “pinch me” moments: you can live near nature without feeling cut off from the modern world.\n\n(The main idea is the system: let delivery handle errands so your days stay calm.)\n\nUbud: incredible… and optional\n\nUbud is special. There are truly great restaurants there. The kind of place you go for a meal that feels like a celebration—without needing a special occasion.\n\nBut here’s the honest part: the traffic can be intense.\n\nAnd what I’ve learned is that you don’t have to build your life around the busiest places to enjoy them. You can treat Ubud like a destination you visit when you want that experience—then come back to the version of Bali that feels like it was designed for families.\n\nFor us, that’s the area in and around Empathy School.\n\nThis is the Bali I didn’t just want to visit. This is the Bali I wanted my kids to grow inside of:\n\nFlowing rice fields that change color with the season\n\nJungle edges that feel alive, not manicured\n\nSpace—real space—for kids to play\n\nA sense of safety and peace that settles into your body\n\nWhen you live somewhere like this, convenience isn’t about luxury. It’s about preserving the calm you came here for.\n\nThe real “Bali hack” for families\n\nPeople sometimes ask what makes day-to-day life work here as a parent.\n\nMy answer is simple: don’t fight the island. Let it carry you.\n\nHere’s what that looks like in our life:\n\nUse Tokopedia + Shopee when you need “stuff” quickly and easily.\n\nUse Delta online when you want groceries without a long outing.\n\nUse Bali Jiva to keep vegetables fresh and effortless.\n\nGo to Ubud for the magic—without making it your weekly commute.\n\nBuild your everyday life around nature, space, and calm—then let delivery handle the logistics.\n\nThis is how you get the best of both worlds: the Bali people dream about, plus the Bali that actually functions when you have kids and routines and real-life needs.\n\nWhy this feels so good\n\nThere’s a particular kind of joy that happens when you move somewhere beautiful and realize you don’t have to sacrifice practicality to enjoy it.\n\nIt’s not just that the kids are happier (though they are). It’s not just that the surroundings are stunning (they are).\n\nIt’s that your days stop being dominated by “life admin.”\n\nInstead of spending your best hours in traffic, you spend them listening to the temple sounds drift through the morning. Watching your kids build something imaginative out of nothing. Walking near rice fields that look like they’ve been painted fresh overnight.\n\nAnd somewhere in the middle of all that, a delivery arrives.\n\nGroceries. Vegetables. The little things.\n\nHandled.\n\nThat’s the 45,000‑rupiah miracle.\n"

      "body": "\nWhen families talk to me about moving to Bali, “Is it safe?” is usually the first real question.\n\nI understand it. Safety isn’t a headline. It’s a daily feeling. It’s whether you can relax while your kids grow up. It’s whether ordinary life stays ordinary.\n\nSo instead of trying to convince you with big statements, I’ll just share what safety looks like in our family’s day-to-day life here—simple routines, small rules, and a community that makes it easy to exhale.\n\nThe Best Safety Upgrade We Made Was… Geography\n\nOur house is near Empathy School.\n\nThat one detail changes everything.\n\nIt means my kids can walk to school. It means mornings don’t start with traffic and rushing and stress. It means the school isn’t a distant destination—it’s part of the neighborhood.\n\nMost mornings, my two boys walk together. Sometimes I’m with them. Sometimes their mom is with them. Sometimes it’s just the two of them, heading down the lane with their backpacks and their own little conversations.\n\nIt’s one of those scenes that still makes me smile every time. It’s calm. It’s sweet. And for me, it’s a huge part of why Bali feels so safe: the place is built for real life, not constant guarding and managing.\n\nThe 6:00 PM Rule That Makes Everyone’s Life Easier\n\nMy older son is 12, which is the age where independence starts to arrive in steady waves.\n\nHe’ll often tell me he’s going to a friend’s house. My rule is straightforward:\n\nYou can go.\n\nTell me in advance.\n\nBe home by 6:00 PM.\n\nSometimes he forgets to tell me ahead of time. He’s 12. It happens. But most of the time, he remembers.\n\nAnd the 6:00 PM boundary works for a few practical reasons: the daylight fades quickly, it’s dinner time, and I don’t want another family to feel like they’re responsible for feeding my kid every night.\n\nWhat I love most is how little “management” this requires. I don’t need a long explanation of where he’ll be every minute. I don’t need a detailed plan. He’s with friends. Sometimes he brings friends to our house, sometimes he’s at theirs.\n\nIt’s easy. It feels normal.\n\nThat’s the kind of safety parents are really looking for.\n\nA Road That’s Not Built for Speed Helps More Than You’d Think\n\nThere’s a small detail between our home and the school that makes a big difference: the road isn’t especially friendly to fast cars.\n\nIt naturally slows things down. It’s more human-scale. That’s a big deal when you have kids walking around.\n\nIn many places, a parent’s worry is shaped by traffic more than anything else. Here, the environment itself encourages slower movement and more awareness. For walking children, that matters every single day.\n\nThe Dogs Are Part of the Neighborhood\n\nYes, there are dogs around. That’s common in Bali.\n\nIn our area, they’re not strangers. My kids know the dogs. I know the dogs. They feel like part of the neighborhood, not a threat.\n\nThere are also periodic vaccination drives in the community, which helps everyone feel more comfortable. And if something ever feels off, there’s usually a direct, human solution: talk to the neighbor who looks after that dog.\n\nOne of the most comforting things about Bali is that people are receptive. If you bring a concern respectfully, you’re usually met with respect in return.\n\nCommunity Is a Kind of Security System\n\nThe Balinese community around us is warm and open. We get invited to temples and ceremonies and shared experiences. There’s a feeling of being included, not kept at arm’s length.\n\nAnd that’s not just “nice.” It’s protective.\n\nWhen you know your neighbors—and they know you—kids are more visible. People notice. People help. It’s not formal. It’s just how daily life works.\n\nSafety is often created by relationship.\n\nA Quick Story About the Police: Calm, Capable, and Close By\n\nA while back, we donated money to help the local police build a radio tower so they could communicate more easily with one another. The school also has a channel on that network.\n\nWe’ve never needed to use it. But it’s there.\n\nThat matters to me—not because I expect emergencies, but because it’s reassuring to know the local systems are real and reachable.\n\nWhen I visited the police station, I asked—mostly out of curiosity—if I could see the jail area. They showed me, and it was… dusty. Cobwebs and all.\n\nI asked when they last used it.\n\nTheir answer was almost charming: the last “situation” was a very drunk farmer they couldn’t get home safely, so they let him sleep there for the night.\n\nThat was it.\n\nNot dramatic. Not scary. Just a community handling a small human problem in a practical way.\n\nEven the School Has Been Treated With Respect\n\nOne of the things I’m most grateful for is this: over the years, we haven’t experienced vandalism on campus. We haven’t had people breaking in and damaging the school.\n\nThat doesn’t mean nothing ever happens anywhere. It just reflects what we’ve lived: a strong baseline of respect for shared spaces, for children, and for the community.\n\nWhat Safety Looks Like for Us, in Simple Terms\n\nIf I had to summarize the habits and conditions that make Bali feel so safe for our family, it would be these:\n\nWe live close enough to walk, so kids aren’t dependent on cars and long commutes.\n\nWe keep rules simple, like “tell us first” and “home by 6.”\n\nThe neighborhood moves at a slower pace, especially on the smaller roads.\n\nThere’s a sense of community presence, not isolation.\n\nLocal support is accessible, and people are responsive when you talk to them.\n\nAnd maybe most importantly: the feeling of safety here isn’t something I have to work hard to create. It’s something the environment supports.\n\nIf You’re Considering Bali\n\nIf you’re thinking about moving your family here, I won’t tell you to ignore your questions. Ask them. Visit. Walk around the neighborhoods you might live in. Notice how your body feels during an ordinary morning.\n\nIn our life here—raising a 12-year-old and a five-year-old—Bali has felt peaceful, welcoming, and deeply safe.\n\nAnd I don’t take that for granted.\n\n—Eric (Founder, Empathy School)\n"
