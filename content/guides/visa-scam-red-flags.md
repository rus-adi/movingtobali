## Quick take

Visa content attracts scammers because families are stressed and timelines feel urgent.
The goal here isn’t fear—it’s a calm pattern-recognition checklist.

We keep this anonymous on purpose: **no names, no accusations**—just red flags and what families do instead.

## Red flags families watch for

### Communication red flags

- Answers that stay vague after you ask the same question twice
- “Don’t worry about it” when you ask for a receipt or a written breakdown
- Constant urgency without clarity

### Money red flags

- A large deposit requested before you receive a written scope
- “Special discounts today only”
- Fees that change every time you ask

### Authority red flags

- “We have a special connection”
- “Guaranteed approval”
- Refusal to reference official portals

## What families do instead

- They compare **2–3 agents** (even if they pick one).
- They ask for a simple written breakdown of fees + timeline.
- They confirm changing details via [Official links](/official-links).
