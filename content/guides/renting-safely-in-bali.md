## Quick take

Renting can be straightforward—until it isn’t. The biggest risk isn’t “Bali”; it’s **rushed decisions**.

If you can: do a short stay first, view in person, verify identity, then sign.

## A staged approach (lower stress)

1. **Short stay (7–21 days)** in your shortlisted area(s)
2. View 5–10 places quickly
3. Verify: owner/agent identity, deposit terms, maintenance expectations
4. Sign a clear agreement
5. Move in, then optimize (don’t optimize first)

## Questions to ask before deposits

- Who is the legal owner / manager?
- What’s the exact deposit amount and refund policy?
- What happens if utilities fail (water, electricity, internet)?
- Who pays for repairs, and what’s the response time?

## What we learned the hard way

“Perfect” listings disappear. But families who know their top 3 priorities can decide quickly without panic.
