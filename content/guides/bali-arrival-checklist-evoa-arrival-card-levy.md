  - q: "Do we need to do anything online before we fly?"
    a: "Often yes. The safest approach is to check the official portals (eVisa/e‑VOA, arrival card, levy) and your airline requirements right before travel, because steps and fees can change."
  - q: "Should we pay the tourist levy in advance?"
    a: "If you choose to, use the official levy site. If you don’t, keep a note to do it shortly after arrival and save your proof of payment."
  - q: "Where can we confirm the current steps?"
    a: "Use the official links list and confirm with your airline or a trusted agent for your exact passport situation."

## Quick start (the calm version)

1. Bookmark **Official links**: [/official-links](/official-links)  
2. Prepare a **single “arrival folder”** (digital + printed): passports, return/onward, accommodation, insurance, kids’ documents.  
3. Decide your airport plan: **stroller**, **snacks**, **bathroom strategy**, **SIM plan**, **cash plan**.  
4. After landing: go slow, hydrate, and keep everything in one bag until you’re through.

> Safety note: we share experience and checklists — not legal or immigration advice. Rules change.

## Before you fly (24–72 hours)

### 1) Confirm the current entry steps
- Open: [/official-links](/official-links)
- Check:
  - eVisa / e‑VOA portal
  - Arrival Card portal
  - Bali tourist levy portal
- If anything looks different than you expected, **pause** and verify (airline + official portal + your agent if you’re using one).

### 2) Build a family “arrival folder”
We keep one folder with:
- Passports (and copies)
- Any visa/approval documents (if applicable)
- Proof of accommodation
- Return/onward booking proof (if applicable)
- Travel/health insurance info (if applicable)
- Kids’ documents (birth certificate scans, school letters if relevant)
- Emergency contacts

### 3) Plan for first-night energy levels
A good landing plan assumes:
- kids are hungry at the wrong time
- everyone needs bathrooms at the same time
- one bag will get searched (so don’t bury essentials)

## Landing day (airport checklist)

### Step 1: Get through the airport calmly
- Keep passports + essential documents in **one pouch**
- Use a simple queue rule: “one adult holds documents, one adult manages kids”
- If you’re traveling with multiple children, decide *ahead of time* who stays with bags

### Step 2: SIM / connectivity plan
Choose one:
- Get a SIM/eSIM before travel (less stress at the airport)
- Get connected after you arrive (fine, but plan for a short “offline window”)

### Step 3: Cash + payments
Have at least a small amount of IDR for:
- snacks/water
- small fees
- taxis (if needed)

### Step 4: Your first transport decision
For a family arrival, we usually plan one of these:
- pre-arranged driver pickup (lowest stress)
- reputable taxi / ride-hail (good backup)

## After you arrive (first 48 hours)

### A) Do a “settle” day
Before you start admin tasks:
- rest
- hydrate
- groceries
- simple meal
- early bedtime

### B) Do the minimum setup tasks
Use this checklist: [First week setup checklist](/guides/first-week-in-bali-setup-checklist)

## What we learned the hard way
When you’re tired, you’re vulnerable to mistakes. The best arrival plan is the one that **assumes you’re not thinking clearly** and keeps decisions simple.
