  - q: "Should we get an eSIM before we arrive?"
    a: "If you want less stress on landing day, yes. If you’re comfortable being offline for a few hours, you can do it after arrival."
  - q: "What’s the first thing to test in a new accommodation?"
    a: "Internet reliability. Test speed and stability at the times you’ll actually use it (morning work blocks and evening streaming)."

## Quick start
- Decide your “arrival plan”: eSIM before you fly vs get a SIM after you land.
- Test internet in your accommodation **before** you commit to routines that depend on it.
- Keep a backup: a second SIM, hotspot plan, or “plan B café”.

## Step 1: Choose your arrival setup
### Option A: eSIM before you fly
Pros: less stress, you land connected  
Cons: you need to set it up calmly before travel

### Option B: SIM after arrival
Pros: flexible  
Cons: landing day becomes more complicated

## Step 2: Internet reliability checklist (copy/paste)
- speed test at morning + evening
- video call stability test
- router location (does it reach bedrooms?)
- power backup (what happens if power drops?)

## Step 3: Family “coordination” setup
- one shared WhatsApp group for your family
- a simple note with your address pinned
- emergency contacts saved offline

## What we learned the hard way
Connectivity feels like a small thing — until it fails during an important call or a tired-kid moment. Set it up early and remove stress.
