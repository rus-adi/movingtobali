## Quick start
- Decide your “comfort goal”: *catastrophic coverage*, *routine coverage*, or *full-service peace of mind*.
- Confirm in writing:
  - what’s covered
  - how claims work
  - where you can go for care
- Don’t buy coverage you don’t understand.

## Step 1: Choose the type of coverage you actually want
### A) Catastrophic-only
Good if:
- you can self-fund routine visits
- you mainly want protection from big surprises

### B) Routine + emergency
Good if:
- you expect regular clinic visits with kids
- you want predictable costs

### C) Premium peace of mind
Good if:
- you want direct billing options
- you want broader support (and accept higher cost)

## Step 2: Ask these questions (copy/paste)
1. What is the deductible and how does it apply?
2. Is dental included? Vision?
3. What counts as an emergency?
4. Do you reimburse or direct bill (and where)?
5. How do you handle pre-existing conditions?
6. What’s excluded in writing?

## Step 3: Pair insurance with a clinic plan
Even with insurance, it helps to decide:
- which clinic you’ll use for routine care
- where you’d go in an emergency

## What we learned the hard way
The right policy is the one that matches your real behavior. If you won’t file reimbursements, don’t buy a plan that relies on reimbursements.
