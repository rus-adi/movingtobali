faqs:
  - q: "Is Bali safe for kids?"
    a: "Many families live here happily, but safety comes from habits: traffic awareness, sun protection, and good water/food practices."
  - q: "What’s the biggest day-to-day risk for families?"
    a: "For many families it’s road safety. The “small risk” tasks add up: crossings, scooters, night driving, and fatigue."
  - q: "How do we avoid overthinking safety?"
    a: "Pick a few high-impact habits (helmets, hydration, mosquito plan, safe swimming rules) and stick to them consistently."

## Quick start (high-impact habits)
- Treat **road safety** as the main daily risk.
- Make a **mosquito plan** (especially at dusk).
- Build a **sun + hydration** routine.
- Choose safe swimming spots and follow “two adult eyes” rules for young kids.

## 1) Road safety (the big one)
- Assume traffic is unpredictable.
- Avoid late-night driving when you’re tired.
- If you use scooters, treat helmets as non‑negotiable.
- For school tours and early weeks, many families use drivers.

## 2) Water and food (simple rules)
We don’t try to be perfect — we aim for consistency:
- drink safe water (ask your accommodation what they provide)
- wash hands before meals (especially after playgrounds)
- keep snacks on hand so kids don’t “crash” into street food choices

## 3) Sun and heat
- hats + sunscreen becomes part of leaving the house
- plan “midday quiet time” when possible
- keep electrolytes on hand for active days

## 4) Mosquitoes (especially evenings)
A practical routine:
- long sleeves at dusk when possible
- repellant where appropriate
- reduce standing water around your home
- if you’re worried, ask a local clinic for the most current guidance

## 5) Swimming and ocean
- Choose beaches with safer conditions for kids (ask locals)
- When in doubt: pool day > risky surf day
- “Two adult eyes” for young kids

## What we learned the hard way
The goal isn’t “zero risk.” It’s building a calm set of habits that reduce risk without taking joy away.
