## The principle (so you don’t overthink it)

Community in Bali is rarely a single discovery.

It’s usually built from **repetition**:

- same places,
- same times,
- same people,

…for long enough that everyone stops feeling like strangers.

---

## Quick start (week 1–2)

If you want your move to feel calmer quickly:

1) Pick **one child anchor** (school/camp/class) that happens weekly.
2) Pick **one parent anchor** (market/cafe/playground/co-working) you’ll repeat.
3) Keep it small for 2 weeks—then expand.

## The 4 “community anchors” that work for most families

### 1) School pick-up (or camp pick-up)

Pick-up is community without pressure.
You’ll see the same parents, and conversations start naturally.

If you’re visiting first, camps can create the same effect:
- [Camps & short-term programs](/camps)

### 2) A weekly class/sport

Kids connect faster when there’s a shared activity.
Parents connect because you’re all waiting together.

### 3) A consistent “food routine”

One market or cafe you repeat becomes social faster than you expect.

### 4) Volunteering (only if it fits your season)

Volunteering is optional.
But when it fits, it can accelerate belonging because you’re contributing, not consuming.

## Simple scripts that reduce awkwardness

These are low-pressure and usually welcomed:

- “Hi, we’re new—what area are you based in?”
- “Do you know any kid-friendly activities around here?”
- “We’re here for a few weeks—any tips for rainy afternoons?”

You don’t need to be extroverted. You just need to repeat the environment.

## What to watch out for (practical safety)

Most groups are lovely, but for family safety:

- Don’t overshare personal details early (address, school details, schedules).
- Prefer meeting in public spaces first.
- For services (nannies, drivers, rentals), use checklists and verify basics.

## What we learned the hard way

The trap is trying a new thing every day.

Novelty feels productive, but it slows community.

Repetition feels boring—but it’s what creates belonging.
