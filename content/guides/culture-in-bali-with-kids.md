## A calm principle (so you don’t overthink it)

We’ve found the safest approach is:

- **be a respectful guest**,
- **ask locals what’s appropriate**,
- and **avoid turning culture into a performance**.

This guide is not a rulebook. Culture differs by village and context.

If you want a copy/paste version: [Culture with kids: quick checklist](/resources/culture-with-kids-quick-checklist).

## Quick start

- Start with **one** cultural touchpoint that’s easy for kids (song, language, small ritual).
- When invited to ceremonies, **ask first**: “Is it okay if we join/watch? Where should we stand?”
- Keep it short for children (snacks + water + exit plan).

## What “respectful participation” looks like in practice

### 1) Ask first (and accept “no” gracefully)

Simple scripts that work:
- “Is it okay for us to join?”
- “Where should we stand?”
- “Is it okay to take a photo?”

When you ask, you’re signaling you understand you’re a guest.

### 2) Dress and behavior

Families do best when they default to:
- modest clothing,
- calm, quiet voices,
- following the flow instead of improvising.

If you’re unsure about what’s expected, copy the checklist: [Culture with kids: quick checklist](/resources/culture-with-kids-quick-checklist).

### 3) Phones and filming

We’ve found the “lowest-risk” rule is:
- **ask first**,
- film less than you think,
- avoid close-ups of people,
- and put the phone away quickly.

### 4) Make it kid-friendly

Even culturally beautiful moments can be overwhelming for kids.

What helps:
- short duration,
- clear boundaries (“we’re watching quietly for 10 minutes”),
- a quiet exit plan,
- a gentle debrief after.

## Supporting social context (optional)

If you’d like a small example of culture/wellness moments families sometimes join, this reel is supporting context:

(Reminder: social is supporting context. The written guide is the primary answer.)

## What we learned the hard way

The mistake isn’t “not knowing enough.”

The mistake is **acting too confident**.

Humility works here. Asking works. Following works.
