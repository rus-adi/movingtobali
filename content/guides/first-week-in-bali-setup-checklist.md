## Quick take

Your first week is not for “optimizing”. It’s for getting a calm baseline.

## First-week checklist

- SIM/eSIM + a stable data plan
- A transport plan (driver, scooter, car—whatever fits your family)
- Grocery routine (one “default shop”)
- A basic healthcare plan (where you go for minor issues)
- A simple schedule for kids (sleep, food, outside time)

## What to postpone

- Perfect housing
- Perfect school schedule
- Perfect budget tracking
