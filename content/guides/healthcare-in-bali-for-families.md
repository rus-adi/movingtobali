## Quick take

We’re not doctors. But families usually do better when they decide their “healthcare mindset” early:
where you go for minor issues, where you go for emergencies, and what insurance choices make sense for your risk tolerance.

## Practical planning

- Choose one clinic you trust for minor issues
- Know your emergency plan (location + transport)
- Keep a small “family medical summary” note in your phone
- Ask other parents what they do (patterns matter)
