## Quick start
- Have **two ways to pay** (backup card).
- Keep a small amount of cash for small purchases.
- Don’t optimize everything on day one.

## Step 1: Decide your “family money system”
A simple system many families use:
- one “daily spending” card
- one backup card kept separate
- a small cash stash for simple purchases

## Step 2: Build a “first week” cash plan
- airport day cash for basics
- groceries and transport buffer
- avoid carrying large amounts until you’re comfortable

## Step 3: Budget clarity beats perfect numbers
If you haven’t already, start with a range-based approach:

## What we learned the hard way
The stressful moments aren’t “we paid a small fee.” They’re “we can’t pay right now.” Backups reduce stress.
