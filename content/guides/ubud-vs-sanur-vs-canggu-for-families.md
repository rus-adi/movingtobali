## Quick comparison (the vibe)
- **Ubud:** green, slower, more “inward,” great for families who want calmer routines
- **Sanur:** beach city energy, easier errands, often a calmer “base”
- **Canggu region:** international, busy, lots happening, more traffic and stimulation

## How to decide (the only 3 questions that matter)
### 1) What pace makes your family calm?
- Do you love “always something on”?
- Or do you want quiet evenings and nature?

### 2) What commute stress can you tolerate?
Some families are fine with driving. Others find it drains energy fast.

### 3) What does “community” mean for you?
- international community and events?
- quieter neighbor friendships?
- school community as your main anchor?

## Ubud (family notes)

- you want green space and calmer routines

## What we learned the hard way
Families often fall in love with an area on a perfect day. Try to include at least one ordinary day: errands, tired kids, and bedtime.
