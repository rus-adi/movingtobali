## Quick take

Two families can live in the “same Bali” and spend wildly different amounts.
Costs mostly come from: **housing expectations, transport style, and school/camp choices**.

## A useful budgeting framework

### Step 1: Write your non-negotiables

Examples:
- Walkable mornings
- Quiet at night
- A kitchen that makes home meals easy

### Step 2: Choose your “big three” cost drivers

For most families:
- Housing
- School / learning
- Lifestyle (restaurants, activities, travel)

### Step 3: Build a range (not a single number)

Use a low / mid / high range so you can adapt.
