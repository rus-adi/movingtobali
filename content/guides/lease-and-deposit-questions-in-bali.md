- Confirm the payment schedule and currency
- Confirm what utilities are included
- Confirm maintenance responsibilities

## The questions that save you stress later

### 1) “What exactly is included?”
Ask about:
- electricity
- water
- internet
- pool/garden maintenance
- cleaning (if any)

### 2) “What happens if something breaks?”
- Who pays for repairs?
- What’s the typical response time?
- How do you report issues?

### 3) “How does the deposit get returned?”
Ask:
- what counts as damage
- what counts as normal wear
- what deductions are allowed
- timeline for return

### 4) “What’s the cancellation or early-exit policy?”
Even if you don’t plan to leave early, clarity reduces risk.

## What we learned the hard way
Contracts feel boring until something goes wrong. A calm checklist before paying is a form of self‑care.
