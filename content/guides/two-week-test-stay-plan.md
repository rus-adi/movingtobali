faqs:
  - q: "Is two weeks enough to decide?"
    a: "Two weeks is often enough to learn what daily life feels like (school run, errands, evenings). Many families still do a longer second trip before signing a lease."
  - q: "How many areas should we try in one visit?"
    a: "Usually 2–3 areas. More than that turns into constant packing and moving, and you never get a routine."
  - q: "What should we avoid during a test stay?"
    a: "Avoid signing long contracts, making school decisions on day one, and booking an accommodation that is too “vacation-perfect” to represent daily life."

## Quick start
- Pick **2–3 areas** using this: [Area shortlist scorecard](/resources/area-shortlist-scorecard)
- For each area, schedule:
  - one “work morning”
  - one “errands afternoon”
  - one “quiet evening”
- Do at least **one rainy day plan** (even if it’s dry season)

## Step 1: Decide what “good” means for your family
Write down your top 3:
- calm mornings
- walkable errands
- community
- green space
- kid activities
- commute simplicity
- budget control

Then pick your “non-negotiable”:
- *We can’t do daily heavy traffic*, or
- *We need walkable basics*, or
- *We need quiet sleep.*

## Step 2: Choose 2–3 areas (not 6)
Shortlists that work:
- **Ubud + Sanur** (nature + calmer beach city)
- **Canggu region + Sanur** (international energy + calmer backup)
- **Ubud + Canggu region** (two very different lifestyles)

## Step 3: Book accommodation that matches real life
A test stay is not a honeymoon. We recommend:
- a place with a kitchen (or easy food options nearby)
- a location that allows you to do “school run timing”
- reliable internet (if you’re working)

## Step 4: Run “routine simulations”

### Optional: add a kids “anchor” (camp or weekly program)

If you’re doing a test stay, one simple way to avoid “holiday mode” is to give kids a predictable anchor for a few days:
- a short holiday camp, or
- a weekly program that runs during the week.

It’s not required—but for many families it makes the visit more realistic (kids have structure, parents can do errands and calls).

Start here:
- [Camps & short-term programs](/camps)
- [Camp questions checklist (copy/paste)](/resources/camp-questions-checklist)

### Simulation A: morning routine
- breakfast
- school/run timing (even if you aren’t enrolled)
- commute test (10–20 minutes driving)

### Simulation B: errands + groceries
- grocery shop
- pharmacy
- quick meal plan
- see how long it takes and how it feels

Guide: [Groceries and routines in Bali](/guides/groceries-meals-routines-in-bali)

### Simulation C: evening + sleep
- dinner
- bedtime
- noise check
- mosquito plan check

## Step 5: Write your notes the same day
Use three prompts:
1. What felt easy today?
2. What felt stressful today?
3. If we did this for 6 months, what would break?

## What we learned the hard way
Families often decide from a “perfect day.” The best decisions come from an ordinary day.
