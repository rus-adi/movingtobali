## Quick start (reduce decision fatigue)
- Choose **3 repeat breakfasts** and **3 repeat dinners** for your first week.
- Keep a “safe snack bag” for outings.
- Build one reliable grocery shop route in your area.

## Step 1: Decide your family food baseline
Write down:
- your kids’ “safe meals”
- any allergies / sensitivities
- your weekly rhythm (busy nights vs calm nights)

## Step 2: Do one “baseline shop”
Buy:
- breakfast basics
- snack basics
- simple proteins
- easy veggies/fruits

## Step 3: Add variety slowly
Once routine feels easy:
- add new cafes or markets
- add new recipes
- add new snacks

## What we learned the hard way
When you’re new, food choices feel like constant decision-making. Routines buy you calm.
