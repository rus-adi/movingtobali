## Quick start
- For your first month, prioritize **low-stress, low-risk** transport.
- Treat scooters as a *choice*, not a default.

## Option 1: Walkable living (the best “transport hack”)
If you can choose an area where:
- groceries are close
- kids’ activities are close
- you can do “small life” without commuting

…your transport stress drops dramatically.

## Option 2: Driver (especially for new families)
A driver can help you:
- get from airport to accommodation calmly
- do housing viewings without chaos
- manage school runs (even short-term tours)

### What to ask a driver
- Are you available at school-run times?
- What’s your preferred communication method?
- What’s your policy if plans change?
- How do you handle car seats (if needed)?

> We avoid listing prices here because they change. Ask a few drivers or agencies and compare reliability and communication first.

## Option 3: Car (control + comfort, higher admin)
A car can be great for:
- multiple kids
- sports gear
- rainy season
…but it adds:
- parking stress in some areas
- maintenance/admin

## Option 4: Scooters (high freedom, higher risk)
Scooters can be practical when:
- you’re confident riding
- you understand local traffic patterns
- you’re strict about helmets and safe habits

Scooters are *not* for everyone, especially in the first weeks. It’s okay to decide “not for us.”

## What we learned the hard way
Transport choices quietly shape your whole Bali experience. If commuting feels stressful, even a perfect villa can stop feeling perfect.
