## Quick take

Most families don’t need the “perfect” visa agent. They need someone who is **clear**, **consistent**, and **honest about uncertainty**.

If an agent communicates well, gives you a checklist, and explains what could go wrong (without drama), that’s usually a better sign than flashy marketing.

## The family checklist

### Ask these questions

- What visa pathway are you recommending, and **why** for our situation?
- What documents do you need from us **before** you start?
- What’s the full fee breakdown (agent fee + government fees + extras)?
- What is the **realistic** timeline—and what commonly causes delays?
- How will you communicate updates (WhatsApp, email) and how often?

### Verify these things

- Their business presence is consistent (same name, same details across channels).
- They use official portals for the parts that require them.
- They provide a written summary (even a simple message) of fees + timeline.

### Prefer agents who say…

- “In our experience…”
- “Rules change—here’s the official link…”
- “We can’t guarantee outcomes, but here’s what we’ll do if it gets stuck.”

## What to avoid

- “Guaranteed approval.”
- Pressure to pay immediately without a written scope.
- Vague fees (“depends” without ranges or examples).
