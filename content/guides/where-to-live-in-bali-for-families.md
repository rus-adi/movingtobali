## Quick take

Most stress comes from commute + noise + mismatched expectations.
A good shortlist is usually 2–3 areas.

## The shortlist method

1. Pick your family pace: calm / mixed / busy
2. Decide commute tolerance (in minutes, not feelings)
3. Choose “daily-life priorities” (walkability, cafes, nature, community)
4. Test-stay in two areas if you can

## Recommended starting points

Browse the area guides: [Areas hub](/areas)

If you want a simple shortlist:
- Try **Sanur** for calmer family routines
- Try **Ubud** for nature + slower pace (some tradeoffs)
- Try **Berawa/Pererenan** if you want more international community (and accept more busy)
