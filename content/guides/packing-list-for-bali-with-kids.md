## Quick start
- Pack for the **first 2–4 weeks**, not forever.
- Prioritize sleep + sun + routines.
- Leave space for what you’ll buy once you understand your life here.

## Essentials (the non-negotiables)
- passports + documents (and copies)
- basic meds you rely on (with appropriate documentation where needed)
- kid comfort items (sleep toys, a familiar blanket)
- sun hats + swim basics
- a small “carry-on survival kit” for landing day

## Family routine helpers
- water bottles
- lunch/snack containers
- basic tech adapters and chargers
- a small first-aid kit

## What we learned the hard way
The best packing list is the one that supports routines. Comfort matters when you’re building a new life.
