Some mornings in Bali start with a soundtrack you didn’t know you needed.

A rooster somewhere in the distance. The soft clink of temple bells. A scooter humming past slowly—less “rush hour,” more “someone’s going to buy fruit.” Incense drifting in from a tiny offering placed neatly on the edge of a driveway. My kids outside, barefoot, already inventing a game out of sticks and leaves and whatever the jungle decides to contribute that day.

It’s the kind of scene people fly across the world to witness for a week.

And yet the thing that still surprises me most isn’t the beauty. It’s the convenience.

Because in the background of all that calm—rice fields flowing like green water, the jungle breathing, the space to actually hear yourself think—Bali has quietly built something that makes daily family life feel… manageable. Even comfortable. Sometimes weirdly effortless.

The number that captures it best is 45,000 rupiah.

That’s the delivery fee I pay for groceries when I don’t want to turn the day into a traffic mission. Less than $3 for someone to bring what my family needs right to our door.

It sounds like a small detail. It’s not.

The best Bali days don’t begin in a car

When families imagine moving to Bali, they picture the big things first:

Nature

Community

A slower pace

A healthier rhythm for their kids

All true.

But the part you only learn by living here is that your day-to-day happiness often depends on the small things: How easy is it to get what you need? How often do errands hijack your schedule? How much time do you spend stuck in transit instead of actually living?

That’s where Bali has been a joyful surprise for me.

If I need something—anything from household essentials to random “we ran out of that and my kids will absolutely notice” items—I open Tokopedia or Shopee, search, tap, and it’s handled. What still amazes me is how often it’s more affordable than America, and how reliably it just works.

It’s not flashy. It’s just… supportive.

And for a family, support is everything.

“Western groceries” without the weekly expedition

I still like going to big grocery stores sometimes. There’s something satisfying about it—choosing, browsing, finding a new snack you didn’t know existed.

But I don’t want that to be my default rhythm. I don’t want “getting groceries” to be a project that consumes half a day and all my patience.

So for many of our staples—especially the “Western products” my family likes—I use online grocery services like Delta online.

And then that number shows up again:

Rp 45,000.

Not just a fee—more like a quiet life upgrade.

Because what that buys isn’t only delivery. It buys time. It buys energy. It buys the kind of afternoon where you’re not recovering from errands—you’re actually present for your kids.

Fresh vegetables that don’t require a plan

Then there’s the produce side of life, where Bali shines in its own way.

For vegetables, I use Bali Jiva.

There’s something deeply satisfying about waking up in a place with temples and rice fields and sunlight pouring in—then having crisp greens show up without you needing to navigate the day around it.

It’s one of those “pinch me” moments: you can live near nature without feeling cut off from the modern world.

(If we add links later for families, I can share what I use—but the main point is the system, not the hyperlink.)

Ubud: incredible… and optional

Ubud is special. There are truly great restaurants there. The kind of place you go for a meal that feels like a celebration—without needing a special occasion.

But here’s the honest part: the traffic can be intense.

And what I’ve learned is that you don’t have to build your life around the busiest places to enjoy them. You can treat Ubud like a destination you visit when you want that experience—then come back to the version of Bali that feels like it was designed for families.

For us, that’s the area in and around Empathy School.

This is the Bali I didn’t just want to visit. This is the Bali I wanted my kids to grow inside of:

Flowing rice fields that change color with the season

Jungle edges that feel alive, not manicured

Space—real space—for kids to play

A sense of safety and peace that settles into your body

When you live somewhere like this, convenience isn’t about luxury. It’s about preserving the calm you came here for.

The real “Bali hack” for families

People sometimes ask what makes day-to-day life work here as a parent.

My answer is simple: don’t fight the island. Let it carry you.

Here’s what that looks like in our life:

Use Tokopedia + Shopee when you need “stuff” quickly and easily.

Use Delta online when you want groceries without a long outing.

Use Bali Jiva to keep vegetables fresh and effortless.

Go to Ubud for the magic—without making it your weekly commute.

Build your everyday life around nature, space, and calm—then let delivery handle the logistics.

This is how you get the best of both worlds: the Bali people dream about, plus the Bali that actually functions when you have kids and routines and real-life needs.

Why this feels so good

There’s a particular kind of joy that happens when you move somewhere beautiful and realize you don’t have to sacrifice practicality to enjoy it.

It’s not just that the kids are happier (though they are). It’s not just that the surroundings are stunning (they are).

It’s that your days stop being dominated by “life admin.”

Instead of spending your best hours in traffic, you spend them listening to the temple sounds drift through the morning. Watching your kids build something imaginative out of nothing. Walking near rice fields that look like they’ve been painted fresh overnight.

And somewhere in the middle of all that, a delivery arrives.

Groceries. Vegetables. The little things.

Handled.

That’s the 45,000‑rupiah miracle.
