## Mistake #1: Planning a single number

A single number makes families anxious because reality moves. Use a **range**.

## Mistake #2: Forgetting the big drivers

Housing expectations + learning costs + lifestyle are the main multipliers.

## Mistake #3: Underestimating “setup month”

The first month often includes extra costs (transport, short stays, deposits, small fixes).

## A calmer approach

Use the [budget range planner](/resources/family-budget-range-planner).
