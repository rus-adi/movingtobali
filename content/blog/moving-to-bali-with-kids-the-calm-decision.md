## Written answer (always first)

The calm decision is: **choose your timeline and your “test-stay plan”** before you try to optimize everything else.

Families who decide “we’ll do 2–4 weeks first, then decide” tend to:
- make fewer rushed deposits,
- choose areas based on real routines,
- and feel less pressure to get the “perfect” visa path on day one.

## A simple test-stay plan

- Pick 2–3 areas to test
- Book short stays (7–10 days each)
- Act like you live there: groceries, commute, bedtime, errands
