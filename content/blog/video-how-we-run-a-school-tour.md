## Written answer (always comes first)

This page demonstrates the **Video Block** standard:
- The written answer is on-page (SEO + accessibility)
- The video is supporting context
- We include a transcript (or a detailed recap)
- A clear, gentle next-step CTA lives under the video

## What to look for on a tour

- Classroom energy and teacher attention
- Support systems (how help happens day-to-day)
- Supervision and safety routines
- Parent communication
- Commute reality at real times
