When families talk to me about moving to Bali, “Is it safe?” is usually the first real question.

I understand it. Safety isn’t a headline. It’s a daily feeling. It’s whether you can relax while your kids grow up. It’s whether ordinary life stays ordinary.

So instead of trying to convince you with big statements, I’ll just share what safety looks like in our family’s day-to-day life here—simple routines, small rules, and a community that makes it easy to exhale.

The Best Safety Upgrade We Made Was… Geography

Our house is near Empathy School.

That one detail changes everything.

It means my kids can walk to school. It means mornings don’t start with traffic and rushing and stress. It means the school isn’t a distant destination—it’s part of the neighborhood.

Most mornings, my two boys walk together. Sometimes I’m with them. Sometimes their mom is with them. Sometimes it’s just the two of them, heading down the lane with their backpacks and their own little conversations.

It’s one of those scenes that still makes me smile every time. It’s calm. It’s sweet. And for me, it’s a huge part of why Bali feels so safe: the place is built for real life, not constant guarding and managing.

The 6:00 PM Rule That Makes Everyone’s Life Easier

My older son is 12, which is the age where independence starts to arrive in steady waves.

He’ll often tell me he’s going to a friend’s house. My rule is straightforward:

You can go.

Tell me in advance.

Be home by 6:00 PM.

Sometimes he forgets to tell me ahead of time. He’s 12. It happens. But most of the time, he remembers.

And the 6:00 PM boundary works for a few practical reasons: the daylight fades quickly, it’s dinner time, and I don’t want another family to feel like they’re responsible for feeding my kid every night.

What I love most is how little “management” this requires. I don’t need a long explanation of where he’ll be every minute. I don’t need a detailed plan. He’s with friends. Sometimes he brings friends to our house, sometimes he’s at theirs.

It’s easy. It feels normal.

That’s the kind of safety parents are really looking for.

A Road That’s Not Built for Speed Helps More Than You’d Think

There’s a small detail between our home and the school that makes a big difference: the road isn’t especially friendly to fast cars.

It naturally slows things down. It’s more human-scale. That’s a big deal when you have kids walking around.

In many places, a parent’s worry is shaped by traffic more than anything else. Here, the environment itself encourages slower movement and more awareness. For walking children, that matters every single day.

The Dogs Are Part of the Neighborhood

Yes, there are dogs around. That’s common in Bali.

In our area, they’re not strangers. My kids know the dogs. I know the dogs. They feel like part of the neighborhood, not a threat.

There are also periodic vaccination drives in the community, which helps everyone feel more comfortable. And if something ever feels off, there’s usually a direct, human solution: talk to the neighbor who looks after that dog.

One of the most comforting things about Bali is that people are receptive. If you bring a concern respectfully, you’re usually met with respect in return.

Community Is a Kind of Security System

The Balinese community around us is warm and open. We get invited to temples and ceremonies and shared experiences. There’s a feeling of being included, not kept at arm’s length.

And that’s not just “nice.” It’s protective.

When you know your neighbors—and they know you—kids are more visible. People notice. People help. It’s not formal. It’s just how daily life works.

Safety is often created by relationship.

A Quick Story About the Police: Calm, Capable, and Close By

A while back, we donated money to help the local police build a radio tower so they could communicate more easily with one another. The school also has a channel on that network.

We’ve never needed to use it. But it’s there.

That matters to me—not because I expect emergencies, but because it’s reassuring to know the local systems are real and reachable.

When I visited the police station, I asked—mostly out of curiosity—if I could see the jail area. They showed me, and it was… dusty. Cobwebs and all.

I asked when they last used it.

Their answer was almost charming: the last “situation” was a very drunk farmer they couldn’t get home safely, so they let him sleep there for the night.

That was it.

Not dramatic. Not scary. Just a community handling a small human problem in a practical way.

Even the School Has Been Treated With Respect

One of the things I’m most grateful for is this: over the years, we haven’t experienced vandalism on campus. We haven’t had people breaking in and damaging the school.

That doesn’t mean nothing ever happens anywhere. It just reflects what we’ve lived: a strong baseline of respect for shared spaces, for children, and for the community.

What Safety Looks Like for Us, in Simple Terms

If I had to summarize the habits and conditions that make Bali feel so safe for our family, it would be these:

We live close enough to walk, so kids aren’t dependent on cars and long commutes.

We keep rules simple, like “tell us first” and “home by 6.”

The neighborhood moves at a slower pace, especially on the smaller roads.

There’s a sense of community presence, not isolation.

Local support is accessible, and people are responsive when you talk to them.

And maybe most importantly: the feeling of safety here isn’t something I have to work hard to create. It’s something the environment supports.

If You’re Considering Bali

If you’re thinking about moving your family here, I won’t tell you to ignore your questions. Ask them. Visit. Walk around the neighborhoods you might live in. Notice how your body feels during an ordinary morning.

In our life here—raising a 12-year-old and a five-year-old—Bali has felt peaceful, welcoming, and deeply safe.

And I don’t take that for granted.
