## What changes

- Travel time (rain slows everything)
- Kids’ regulation (less outside time can show up fast)
- Plans (you learn to keep “indoor defaults” ready)

## What doesn’t

- The importance of routines
- The value of a calm commute
- The need for one anchor community

## Practical rainy-season defaults

- One indoor activity you can do daily
- A simple “wet day” transport plan
- Earlier afternoons (kids get tired)
