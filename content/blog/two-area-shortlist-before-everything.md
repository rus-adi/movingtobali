## The short version

Area is a multiplier. It changes:
- daily calm (noise + commute),
- budget (rent + lifestyle),
- and which learning communities are realistically accessible.

## The shortlist method (2–3 areas)

1. Choose your pace: calm / mixed / busy
2. Decide commute tolerance (minutes)
3. Pick 3 daily-life priorities (walkability, nature, community, etc.)
4. Test-stay if you can
