## Copy/paste questions

### Supervision (the most important section)

- What’s the **adult-to-child ratio** for my child’s age group?
- How do you handle supervision during **transitions** (arrival, bathroom, snack, moving between activities)?
- Who is the “home base” adult my child can return to if they’re overwhelmed?

### Safety + health

- What’s your protocol for **injuries**? (first aid, escalation, when parents are contacted)
- What’s the plan for **illness** (fever, vomiting, etc.)?
- Do you have staff trained in first aid?
- How do you manage **water safety** (if relevant)?

### Allergies + medical needs

- Can you accommodate allergies? What’s the procedure to prevent cross-contact?
- Can you support medication plans (if needed)?
- Who should we inform if a child has sensory needs, anxiety, or support requirements?

### Drop-off / pick-up (security)

- How do you confirm the correct adult is collecting a child?
- What happens if a parent is late?
- Is there a secure handover point (especially for younger kids)?

### Schedule + environment

- What does a typical day look like? (start/end time, indoor/outdoor balance, breaks)
- What do kids do during hot/rainy periods?
- How do you keep kids hydrated and protected from sun?

### Staff quality

- Who are the adults on the ground each day? (teachers, facilitators, assistants)
- How long have they worked with children?
- Who is the point of contact for parents?

### Communication

- How do you communicate with parents (WhatsApp, email, daily notes)?
- Will we get photos or updates—and how often?
- Who do we contact if something feels off?

### Refunds + cancellations

- What is the refund policy if:
  - my child gets sick,
  - we need to change dates,
  - the camp is cancelled,
  - weather disrupts the schedule?
- What exactly is included in the fee (meals, activities, transport)?

### Photos + privacy

- Do you post children publicly on social media?
- How do parents give (or decline) consent?

## A calm decision rule

If a camp can’t answer the questions above clearly, it’s usually a sign to:
- choose a shorter commitment, or
- choose a different program.

Clarity beats hype.
