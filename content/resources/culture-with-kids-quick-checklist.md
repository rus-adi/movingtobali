## Culture with kids (a calm, respectful approach)

This is **experience-based guidance**, not an official authority.
Culture differs by village and context. When in doubt: **ask**, follow local guidance, and stay humble.

### Before you go

- **Ask first:** “Is it okay for us to join/watch?”
- **Dress modestly** (especially for temples/ceremonies): covered shoulders, respectful clothing, and follow local expectations.
- **Keep it simple for kids:** short duration, clear boundaries, snacks/water.
- **Bring a small offering/donation** if your local community suggests it.

### During cultural moments

- **Follow the flow:** stand where others stand, wait when others wait.
- **Don’t treat it like a show:** avoid loud commentary, avoid directing kids like you’re filming.
- **Photos/video:** ask if it’s okay, and avoid filming people closely.
- **Kids first:** if your child is overwhelmed, step out quietly and return later.

### After

- **Debrief gently:** ask kids what they noticed, what felt different, what they liked.
- **Keep it relational:** the goal isn’t “understanding everything,” it’s learning how to be respectful guests.
