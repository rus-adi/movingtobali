## The range planner

Instead of one number, plan **low / mid / high**.

### Step 1: Choose your baseline lifestyle

- Home meals most days?
- Eating out most days?
- Travel every month?

### Step 2: Budget the big drivers

- Housing
- Learning (school/camps)
- Transport
- Healthcare/insurance buffer

### Step 3: Create your “stress test”

Ask: *If costs jump 20% for one month, are we okay?*
