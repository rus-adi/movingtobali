Education & budgets (short) — detailed recap (not verbatim)

- Education is one of the biggest “swing factors” in family budgets when relocating to Bali.
- Before you try to calculate exact numbers, decide your range and your priorities:
  - learning style / support needs
  - location/commute reality
  - whether you’re using a short-term program first
- Use ranges, then refine after a test stay and a few tours.
- Ask for a full fee list early (registration, uniforms, transport, lunch, activities) so you don’t get surprised later.
