Detailed recap (not a verbatim transcript)

This is a highlight reel, so there isn’t much spoken dialogue to capture word-for-word. Instead, use this recap as a parent-friendly “viewing guide” so the video is useful for decision-making.

What this video helps you evaluate

1) The daily rhythm
- Does the camp day look calm, chaotic, or well-paced?
- Do you see predictable routines (arrival, activity transitions, snack/lunch, regrouping)?

2) Supervision you can feel
- Do adults look present and attentive during high-risk moments (play, transitions, water/edges, tools)?
- Are children clustered with a clear “home base” adult, or does it feel unstructured?

3) Fit for your child
- Is it high-energy and social, or quieter and nature-focused?
- Would your child feel regulated in this environment?

4) The environment
- How much time appears to be outdoors vs indoors?
- Is the space shaded, safe, and appropriate for the age group you’re considering?

Questions to ask after watching (copy/paste)
- What supervision ratios do you use for my child’s age group?
- What’s your protocol for injuries or illness?
- How do drop-off and pick-up work (and how do you verify the right adult)?
- What are the refund / cancellation terms?
- How do you communicate with parents during camp?
