What it is:
- A simple, family-friendly cultural touchpoint: a children’s song presented in video form.
- We use it on this hub as an easy “bridge” for families: something kids can enjoy while you begin learning how culture shows up in daily life.

How to use it as a parent:
1) Keep it light.
   - You don’t need to “understand everything” on day one.
   - Let your child enjoy the rhythm and repetition.

2) Follow with one gentle question.
   - “What did you notice?”
   - “What sounded different?”
   - “What did you like?”

3) Connect it to real life.
   - If your child is learning songs at school/camp, ask teachers what they’re practicing and how families can join respectfully.

Respect note:
- Culture varies by village and context. When you’re joining cultural moments (ceremonies/temples), the best move is always to ask locals what’s appropriate.
