[Detailed recap placeholder — replace with the real YouTube transcript when available]

This site standard is: every embedded video should have a transcript (best) or a detailed recap (acceptable) for SEO + accessibility.

We have not pulled the official transcript in this build. Please replace this file with the real transcript from YouTube (“Show transcript”) before relying on it for indexing.

Suggested recap structure for the Empathy School 360° tour (fill in with what you actually see):

00:00 Intro — what this tour covers
00:30 Campus entrance + first impressions
01:15 Classroom spaces — how rooms are laid out and used
02:30 Outdoor areas — nature time, play spaces, shaded areas
03:45 Project / activity areas — hands-on learning spaces
05:00 Daily flow — how kids move through the campus
06:30 Parent logistics — drop-off/pick-up, where parents wait (if shown)
07:30 Closing — what to do next / how to book a tour

Notes to capture while you review:
- What feels calm / regulated vs overstimulating
- Where kids can focus quietly vs be active
- What you want to ask about supervision and support
- What kind of child might thrive here (and who might not)
