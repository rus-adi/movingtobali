faqs:
- q: How long should we visit before deciding to relocate?
  a: If you can, plan at least 2–4 weeks. It’s enough time to feel routines (school
    run, errands, evenings) rather than just holiday mode.
- q: What should we decide first?
  a: 'Timeline + budget + area short list. Those three decisions shape almost everything
    else: visas, housing, and school options.'
- q: How long should we stay in Bali before committing long-term?
  a: If you can, plan a test stay long enough to experience normal routines (school
    run, groceries, bedtime, rainy days). Many families find 2–6 weeks gives clearer
    signal than a quick holiday.
- q: Do we need to ride a motorbike as a family?
  a: Not necessarily. Many families use a car + driver, ride-hail apps, or walkable
    micro-areas. The right choice depends on your kids’ ages, your risk tolerance,
    and how far your daily commute is.
- q: What are the first 3 decisions that make the rest easier?
  a: Pick a realistic visa pathway, choose 1–2 areas to test (based on commute + routines),
    and set a simple monthly budget range. Those three decisions reduce most downstream
    stress.

## Quick start

- If you’re brand new to the idea, **sketch your timeline** (next 3 months vs next year).
- Shortlist **2–3 areas** before you overthink school or housing.
- Keep **official links** bookmarked for anything that changes fast (especially visas).
- Prefer decisions that reduce stress: **short test-stays, staged commitments, clear contracts**.

## The calm roadmap

### Step 1: Decide your timeline

Write down the earliest date you could arrive—and the latest date you’d still feel good about.

### Step 2: Shortlist areas

Use the [Areas](/areas) hub to shortlist 2–3 places that match your family’s pace and commute tolerance.

### Step 3: Plan visas from experience (not certainty)

We share what families experienced and the questions to ask. We don’t guarantee outcomes. For changing details, use [Official links](/official-links).

### Step 4: Housing (staged, not rushed)

If possible: short stay → view in person → verify → sign. Rushing deposits is where families get burned.

### Step 5: Learning & community

A good-fit learning environment plus one parent community usually does more for “settling in” than any single logistics hack.

## What we learned the hard way

The biggest stress reducer wasn’t “perfect planning”—it was **staged commitments**. Keep optionality early, then commit once you’ve seen the reality.
