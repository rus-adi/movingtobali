  summary: 'A highlight reel from Empathy School’s summer camp. Use it to sense the
    rhythm (outdoor time, group energy, daily flow)—then compare what you see against
    the questions that actually matter: supervision, safety, refunds, and parent communication.'

faqs:
- q: Are camps worth it if we’re only visiting Bali for 2–4 weeks?
  a: Often, yes. A short camp or weekly program can give kids structure and friends
    quickly—while you handle housing, errands, and the realities of daily life.
- q: What’s the difference between a holiday camp and a weekly program?
  a: Holiday camps are short, seasonal bursts (winter/summer breaks). Weekly programs
    usually run during school terms and can work well for families staying 1–3 months
    or longer.
- q: What should we ask before we pay a deposit?
  a: Supervision ratios, safety policies, refund terms, allergy/medical handling,
    drop-off/pick-up security, and how staff communicate with parents.
- q: How do we avoid ‘camp hype’ when choosing?
  a: 'Choose clarity over vibes: written policies, clear schedules, and straightforward
    communication beat glossy marketing every time.'
- q: Do camps work for short-stay families or visitors?
  a: Often yes, especially during school holidays. The key is to confirm age range,
    daily schedule, what to bring, and whether you can book by day or by week.

## Quick start (the fast version)

- If you’re planning a **test-stay**, camps can help you avoid “holiday mode” by giving kids structure fast.
- Aim for **staged commitment**: try a short program first, then decide.
- Before you pay anything, copy/paste this: [Camp questions checklist](/resources/camp-questions-checklist).
- Choose **clarity over hype**: written policies, clear pick-up/drop-off, and simple communication.

## How camps fit into a Bali move (3 common patterns)

### Pattern 1: “We’re visiting to see if Bali is right.”

A 1–2 week camp or weekly program can give your child:
- routines,
- friends,
- a sense of “normal life,”

…while you test commutes, groceries, clinics, and daily logistics.

### Pattern 2: “We’re in-between: visas / housing / settling in.”

Camps can work as a **transition buffer**, especially in the first weeks when:
- your routines aren’t stable yet,
- you’re still viewing housing,
- you’re doing a lot of admin.

### Pattern 3: “We live here, but we need coverage during breaks.”

Seasonal camps can be a practical way to cover:
- holiday blocks,
- visiting family seasons,
- periods when your work ramps up.

## Empathy Camp (our programs)

This hub is published by Empathy School, so we’ll always be transparent when we share our own camps.

## What to ask before you enroll (copy/paste)

Use the full template here: [Camp questions checklist](/resources/camp-questions-checklist).

A short version (the questions that prevent most problems):

- **Supervision:** What’s the adult-to-child ratio, and how is it handled during transitions (bathroom, snack, arrival)?
- **Safety:** What happens for injuries? Who calls parents? Where is first aid kept?
- **Drop-off / pick-up:** How do you ensure the right adult is collecting the child?
- **Allergies / medical:** How are allergies managed? Can you accommodate medication plans?
- **Refunds:** What are the terms if a child gets sick or plans change?
- **Communication:** How will you update parents—daily notes, WhatsApp, email?

  <div class="mt-4 whitespace-pre-wrap text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
While you watch, try to answer:
- Do you see consistent adult presence (supervision you can feel)?
- Does the day look over-scheduled, chaotic, or calm?
- Would your child thrive with this amount of outdoor time and group energy?

Then follow up with the checklist questions—because the “boring details” are what make camps feel safe.

## Seasonal camps (winter / summer / mid-term holidays)

Seasonal camps are great for:
- families visiting from overseas during school breaks,
- families living in Bali who want structured blocks during holidays.

Because dates change, we treat seasonal content as **examples + social proof**, not the source-of-truth schedule.

## Weekly programs (great for 3–12 month stays)

If your family is staying for a season (or you’re easing into life here), weekly programs can be a strong middle ground:
- more stable routine than a one-off holiday camp,
- lower “commitment risk” than full enrollment,
- easier to adjust if your area/housing changes.

## What we learned the hard way

The biggest stress reducer wasn’t “finding the perfect camp.” It was choosing camps with **clear systems**:
- clear supervision,
- clear policies,
- clear refund terms,
- clear communication.

A great vibe without clarity often becomes stressful by day two.

---

## What to watch out for (practical red flags)

- No written supervision/safety policy (or they dodge simple questions).
- Vague drop-off / pick-up process (especially for younger kids).
- Pressure to pay a deposit before you’ve seen a schedule or terms.
- No allergy/medical plan.
- Communication is chaotic (slow, inconsistent, or unclear).

If you’re unsure, start with a shorter commitment and reassess.
