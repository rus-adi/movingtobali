## Quick start

- If you’re brand new to the idea, **sketch your timeline** (next 3 months vs next year).
- Shortlist **2–3 areas** before you overthink school or housing.
- Keep **official links** bookmarked for anything that changes fast (especially visas).
- Prefer decisions that reduce stress: **short test-stays, staged commitments, clear contracts**.

## The calm roadmap

### Step 1: Decide your timeline

Write down the earliest date you could arrive—and the latest date you’d still feel good about.

### Step 2: Shortlist areas

Use the [Areas](/areas) hub to shortlist 2–3 places that match your family’s pace and commute tolerance.

### Step 3: Plan visas from experience (not certainty)

We share what families experienced and the questions to ask. We don’t guarantee outcomes. For changing details, use [Official links](/official-links).

### Step 4: Housing (staged, not rushed)

If possible: short stay → view in person → verify → sign. Rushing deposits is where families get burned.

### Step 5: Learning & community

A good-fit learning environment plus one parent community usually does more for “settling in” than any single logistics hack.

## What we learned the hard way

The biggest stress reducer wasn’t “perfect planning”—it was **staged commitments**. Keep optionality early, then commit once you’ve seen the reality.
