faqs:
  - q: "What matters most when choosing a school in Bali?"
    a: "In our experience, the big four are: learning style + values, student support, commute reality, and parent communication. If those fit, everything else gets easier."
  - q: "How many schools should we tour?"
    a: "Usually 2–4 is enough. More can overwhelm you. Tour the best-fit options in your top 2–3 areas, at real commute times."
  - q: "What should we watch for beyond the marketing?"
    a: "Classroom energy, how support actually works day-to-day, supervision routines, and how the school communicates with parents."
  - q: "Should we decide school before housing?"
    a: "Often it’s better to shortlist areas first. Then tour schools within those areas so you’re not committing to a commute you’ll hate."
  - q: "Do you list every school in Bali?"
    a: "No. We share a framework and tour questions. We’ll mention a few common options families consider, but the goal is fit—not a giant directory."

## Quick start (the fast version)

- Start with **fit**, not reputation: values + learning style, support, commute, and communication.
- Shortlist **2–3 areas first**, then tour schools inside those areas (so you don’t lock in a brutal daily drive).
- Tour at real times: **morning drop-off** + **afternoon pick-up**.
- Copy/paste this: [School tour question list](/resources/school-tour-question-list).
- If you can, use staged commitment: **trial / short term → term → longer commitment**.

---

## The school-fit framework (what matters most)

### 1) Values + learning style

Ask yourself: does your child thrive with structure, flexibility, project-based learning, nature-based days, or more traditional academics?

On tours, ignore the glossy language and look for **real examples**:
- What kids are making / reading / practicing
- How teachers respond when a child is stuck
- How independence is built (or not)

### 2) Support (how help actually works)

Many schools *say* they support diverse learners. The real question is how support works **day-to-day**.

Useful questions:
- What does support look like in a normal week?
- Who provides it (class teacher, support teacher, counselor)?
- How is progress shared with parents?

### 3) Safety + supervision (clarity over vibes)

You don’t need perfection — you need **clear systems**:
- supervision ratios,
- pick-up / drop-off routine,
- injury protocol,
- who contacts you and how.

### 4) Commute reality

In Bali, commute is *not* a small detail. It affects:
- your child’s daily energy,
- your ability to have routines,
- whether the move feels calm or chaotic.

Do a real-time commute test (or ask parents in your target area what their actual times are).

### 5) Parent communication + community

Strong schools communicate early and clearly:
- expectations,
- what happens when a child struggles,
- how parents stay in the loop,
- what community support exists for new families.

---

## A simple shortlist process (that avoids overwhelm)

1) **Write your non-negotiables** (support needs, learning style, commute max, language needs).
2) Shortlist **2–3 areas** first. (Start here: [Areas hub](/areas).)
3) Pick **3–5 schools** across those areas.
4) Tour **2–4** of the best fits.
5) Use a trial period if available.

## Empathy School (Ubud): tours + programs

<div class="rounded-2xl border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 p-6">
  <strong class="text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900">Why we include Empathy School here</strong>
  <p class="mt-3 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">This hub is built by Empathy School, and we’re one of the few groups with real, public video tours. Even if you’re comparing multiple schools, using one consistent “reference tour” helps you notice what you actually care about.</p>
  <ul class="mt-4 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
    <li><strong>Ages:</strong> 1–14 (Early Years → Middle School)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Ubud area</li>
    <li><strong>Best for:</strong> families who want calm routines, nature, and a community feel</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mt-4 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">If you want to see whether it’s a fit, the easiest next step is to tour (in person or video-first) and then ask specific questions about support + commute.</p>
</div>

### Optional: a standard tour video (non‑360)

  <div class="mt-4 whitespace-pre-wrap text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">
Suggested notes to capture when you review the video:
- What spaces matter most to your child (quiet corners, outdoor time, project areas)
- What you notice about classroom energy and teacher attention
- What questions you want to ask in a live tour about support, safety, and routines

Tip: if you want the exact transcript, open the video on YouTube and use the built-in “Show transcript” feature.

## Parent voices (testimonials)

These short clips are useful for tone and fit — treat them as **supporting context**, not the only input.

## A few schools families commonly compare (not an exhaustive list)

We’re not publishing a giant directory here. But families often ask “what else should we look at?”

Here are a few *common* options to research (visit their official sites and tour in person):

- Green School Bali
- Canggu Community School
- Bali Island School
- Australian Independent School (AIS Bali)
- Dyatmika School
- Pelangi School (Ubud)

---

## What to watch out for (practical, not scary)

- **Unclear support promises:** if you can’t get a straight answer on how support works week-to-week, assume it’s inconsistent.
- **Commute denial:** if everyone “says it’s fine,” do the commute yourself at drop-off times.
- **Communication gaps:** a calm move needs clear parent communication — ask to see examples.
- **Hidden costs:** uniforms, registration, activities, transport, lunch — ask for a full list.
