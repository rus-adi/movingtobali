## Quick take

Kerobokan can feel **more residential** than the beach hotspots and is sometimes chosen for **value + practicality**—but your daily experience depends on exactly where you are and where you need to commute.

## Who this area fits

- Families who want to be near Seminyak / Canggu region without being on the busiest streets
- Parents who want a home base that supports routines (sleep, groceries, quiet evenings)

## Tradeoffs

- Some routes can still be slow at peak times
- “Nice on a map” isn’t the same as “easy day-to-day” — test your commute
