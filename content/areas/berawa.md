## Quick take

A popular pocket near Canggu with many family services—convenient, but traffic can be intense at peak times.

## Who this area fits

- Families who value **community + convenience**
- Parents who can accept the tradeoffs (listed below)

## What daily life feels like

- Mornings: school runs, errands, coffee, and routines
- Afternoons: heat/rain rhythms, activities, and kid energy
- Evenings: where it’s calm vs where it stays busy

## Tradeoffs (be honest)

- Commute: some routes are fine until peak times
- Noise: depends heavily on the exact street
- “Pretty” vs “practical”: don’t choose only from photos

## A simple way to test

If you can, do a 7–14 day stay and act like you live there:
groceries, commute at real times, bedtime routines.
