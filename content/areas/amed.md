## Quick take

Amed is a **quiet coastal option** that some families love for the slower pace. It tends to suit families who don’t need constant activities and services nearby.

## Who this area fits

- Families who want a calmer, nature-focused lifestyle
- Parents who enjoy simple routines and quieter days

## Tradeoffs

- Longer trips for some services and activities
- Transport planning matters (especially with younger kids)

## What to test
- Grocery and essentials route
- Clinic access and what you’d do in an emergency (plan, not panic)
- Internet reliability if you work remotely
